# LegoPump
Control software for a microfluidic pump made out of LEGOs

# Motivation
One big problem in microfluidics is that precise pumps are very hard to manufacture. 
Many have tried to create precise pumps to push fluids through microfluidic chambers, and to the naked eye, they look perfectly reasonable. 
However, when dealing with applications as precise as microfluidics, even the slightest perturbations can be catastrophic to experiments. 
Thus, the materials currently used in microfluidics are machined to be extremely precise, making them very expensive. 
However, if we want to improve the pace of biological and microfluidic research, then we need to make these pumps easier to manufacture. 
This project aims to exploit the precision of LEGO blocks in order to create a microfluidic pump made mainly out of LEGOs.

# Current progress
Currently, all that's on this repo is a snapsot of a raspberry pi server from a previous project. 
Much of this code will be replaced to account for the specific problem that this project is aiming to solve.
