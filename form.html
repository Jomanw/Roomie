Shit to do: <br>
-Put all of the list sorting algorithms into animations on the LED Strip! <br>
-Add buttons to select primary colors for use both in animations and in static displays<br>
-Add microphone to listen to the volume of the music, and adjust brightness based on music/adjust parameters of
animations based on music speeds <br>


To increase speed, maybe open up multiple child processes at the very beginning, or maybe as another loop is running, open another child process.
Basically, whenever the user changes an option, they have to wait for another process to start, which takes time. However, if you have a
process just running and ready to go, then you could quickly kill the current process, send a message to the one that you started a while
ago so it can immediately start running, and then start a new one to be used later when the current one is killed. This way, you
always have one in the background, ready to go.
